Challenges/Things Left to Do 
* August 5-7 Long Weekend
   * Avi and Elena will be away for the long weekend, but we will mitigate the effects of our absence by working as much on the implementation as possible beforehand to reduce the amount of work we will have afterwards.
* PHP Learning Curve
   * Since the three of us have never worked with PHP before, we will have to overcome a learning curve within a short amount of time. We will utilize resources such as YouTube, GitHub repos, and TAs to ensure we can implement our project with as minimal bugs and as smoothly as possible.
